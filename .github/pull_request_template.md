Hi, this is a pull request template text which aims to give you some
instructions on how to proceed further. Please replace it with actual
description of the proposed changes.

First of all, please note that most files in this repo are just copies from the
llvm/llvm-project Github repository, so, it would be better if you will
contribute them there. See corresponding [docs](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html#how-to-submit-a-patch)

However, if you are not familiar with llvm-project or you have found an issue
in a file which is unique to this repo, please proceed and make a PR - it will
be either redirected to llvm-project or accepted here.
